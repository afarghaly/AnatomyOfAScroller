## Companion Article

## Requirements
- iOS 12 or above
- Swift 5
- Note: it is strongly recommended to run this project on a real device, as the simulator's SpriteKit performance is not representative. You will need to add a Development Team to the project's Signing and Capabilities section

## Known Issues
- Tapping on the theme selection button will cause some autolayout constraint errors in the console. This appears to be a [known issue with UIAlertController](http://www.openradar.me/49289931)
